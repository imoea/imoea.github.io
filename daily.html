      <p>On creative thinking:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Discover something completely new.</b> Seek things that the world has never seen but would be nice to have.</li>
        <li><b>Find hints in all sorts of places.</b> There are inspirations that spark new ideas all around you just waiting to be found.</li>
        <li><b>Nurturing an idea.</b> An invention isn't for just one person; have everyone use it.</li>
        <li><b>Look at things from every angle.</b> Investigate every perspective.</li>
        <li><b>Don't just go with the status quo.</b> Think over what you think are usual.</li>
        <li><b>Never give up.</b> Even if you fail the first time and the second time, keep on trying.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>On how to become a good leader:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Don't dwell on past decisions. <b>Always look forwards.</b></li>
        <li><b>Don't be afraid of change.</b> They are opportunities for you to grow.</li>
        <li>To acquire a breadth of understanding, <b>read about everything</b>. Everything is adjacent to something. Collect enough dots, and you will soon learn to connect them.</li>
      </ol>
